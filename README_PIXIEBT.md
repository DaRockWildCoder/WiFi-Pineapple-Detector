**Bluetooth Device Monitoring & Protection Tool**

PixieBT monitors the Bluetooth environment around your devices, detects unauthorized connections **to** your protected devices, and automatically launches counter-offensives against intruders.

Key concept: a **two-level whitelist** defines which devices are yours, and which peers are allowed to connect to each one.

### Python Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install termcolor
```

### System Tools

| Tool | Package | Used for |
|------|---------|----------|
| `hciconfig` | `bluez` | Interface management |
| `hcitool` | `bluez` | Scanning (inquiry, lescan, connections) |
| `l2ping` | `bluez` | L2CAP flood counter-offensive |

```

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<repo>/WiFi-Pineapple-Detector.git
cd WiFi-Pineapple-Detector
pip3 install termcolor
```

---

## Configuration

### pixiebt.conf

Bluetooth interface configuration file:

```ini
[bluetooth]
interface = hci0
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `interface` | HCI Bluetooth interface (e.g., `hci0`, `hci1`) |

> The script automatically offers to bring the interface UP if it is down.

## Usage Modes

### Mode 1 — Scan & Whitelist

Two-step interactive setup: first select **your devices** (to protect), then for each one, define which **peers are allowed** to connect to it.

```bash
sudo python3 pixiebt.py -m 1
```

**Step 1 — Select your devices:**
1. Scans Classic BT + BLE (configurable)
2. Displays a numbered table of all discovered devices
3. You select which ones are **yours** (the ones to protect)

**Step 2 — Define allowed peers per device:**
4. For each protected device, you select which **other devices** are permitted to connect to it
5. Options: comma-separated numbers, `all`, `none` (any connection = alert), or `keep` (keep existing peers)
6. Saves everything to `pixiebt_whitelist.json`

**Interactive flow example:**
```
  =============================================
    STEP 1 — Select YOUR devices (to PROTECT)
  =============================================
   #   MAC                 NAME                         TYPE
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   1   AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01   MyHeadphones                 classic
   2   AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02   FitnessBand                  ble
   3   11:22:33:44:55:66   MyPhone                      classic
   4   77:88:99:AA:BB:CC   UnknownDevice                ble

  [?] Enter numbers of YOUR devices to protect: 1,2

  =============================================
    STEP 2 — For each device, select ALLOWED peers
  =============================================

  ┌─ Device: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01 (MyHeadphones)
  │  Available peers:
  │   1    11:22:33:44:55:66   MyPhone [classic]
  │   2    77:88:99:AA:BB:CC   UnknownDevice [ble]
  │
  │  [?] Allowed peers for this device: 1
  └─ Saved: MyHeadphones — 1 peer(s)

  ┌─ Device: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02 (FitnessBand)
  │  [?] Allowed peers for this device: none
  └─ Saved: FitnessBand — no peers (monitor-only)

  WHITELIST SUMMARY
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01 (MyHeadphones) [classic]
    └─ allowed: 11:22:33:44:55:66 (MyPhone)
  AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02 (FitnessBand) [ble]
    └─ no peers allowed (any connection = alert)
```

**Mode-specific options:**
- `-t <seconds>`: Scan duration per scan type (default: 10s)
- `--no-ble`: Disable BLE scanning (Classic BT only)

---

### Mode 2 — Monitor & Counter-Offensive

Continuous monitoring with 4 parallel threads. Detects any device that is **not an allowed peer** of your protected devices and launches automatic counter-offensives.

```bash
sudo python3 pixiebt.py -m 2
```

**Detection logic:**
- A device that is in "my devices" = protected, never attacked
- A device that is a designated "allowed peer" of at least one protected device = trusted
- Any other device = intruder → **alert + counter-offensive**
- If a device has `"allowed_peers": {}` (none), ANY connection involving it triggers an alert

**4 parallel threads:**

| Thread | Function | Interval |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Classic scan** | Inquiry scan for non-whitelisted Classic BT devices | 30s |
| **BLE scan** | Advertisement scan for non-whitelisted BLE devices | 15s |
| **Connection monitor** | Checks active HCI connections for unauthorized MACs | 5s |
| **Counter-offensive** | Automatic retaliation against each detected intruder | 5s |

**Counter-offensive by device type:**

| Device Type | Counter-Measure | Effect |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **Classic BT** | `l2ping -s 600 -f` (L2CAP flood) + name request spam | Saturates the intruder's BT radio, makes it unreachable |
| **BLE** | Connection flood (`lecc` → `ledc` repeated) | Saturates the BLE radio, prevents legitimate connections |
| **Active connection** | L2CAP flood (same as Classic) | Disrupts and degrades the unauthorized connection |

**Alert example:**

```
  [!!!] UNAUTHORIZED CONNECTION → MYHEADPHONES
        Intruder MAC : 77:88:99:AA:BB:CC
        Name         : UnknownDevice
        Type         : ble
        Target device: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01 (MyHeadphones)
        Via          : active connection
        Time         : Sat Mar 22 14:30:00 2026
        [>>>] COUNTER-OFFENSIVE ENGAGED

  [>>>] L2CAP flood started → 77:88:99:AA:BB:CC
```

**Periodic summary (every 15s):**
- Number of intruders detected
- Number of active L2CAP floods
- Scan counters (classic, BLE, connection checks)
- Per-intruder status: MAC, name, type, detection count, flood status

```
[*] Status: 2 intruder(s) detected | 1 active flood(s) | scans: 4 classic, 8 BLE, 45 conn checks
[*] Counter-offensive: 2 L2CAP flood(s) started, 5 BLE disruption(s)
    AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF (SuspiciousDevice) [classic] — seen 3x via inquiry scan [FLOODING]
    11:22:33:44:55:66 (<unknown>) [ble] — seen 7x via BLE scan
```

> ⚠️ **Whitelist required**: Run mode 1 first to define your trusted devices.

## Generated Files

| File | Description | Created by |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `pixiebt.conf` | Interface configuration (create manually) | user |
| `pixiebt_whitelist.json` | Two-level whitelist `{device: {name, type, allowed_peers}}` | mode 1 |

### pixiebt_whitelist.json format

```json
{
  "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01": {
    "name": "MyHeadphones",
    "type": "classic",
    "allowed_peers": {
      "11:22:33:44:55:66": "MyPhone"
    }
  },
  "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02": {
    "name": "FitnessBand",
    "type": "ble",
    "allowed_peers": {}
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Human-readable name of your device |
| `type` | `classic` or `ble` |
| `allowed_peers` | Map of `{MAC: name}` for devices allowed to connect to this device. Empty `{}` means **any connection triggers an alert**. |

> Backward compatible: older formats (`{mac: name}`, `{mac: {name, type}}` without peers, or `[mac, ...]`) are automatically converted on load.

## Examples

```bash
# Quick scan (10 seconds, classic + BLE)
sudo python3 pixiebt.py -m 1

# Longer scan (30 seconds)
sudo python3 pixiebt.py -m 1 -t 30

# Classic Bluetooth only scan (no BLE)
sudo python3 pixiebt.py -m 1 --no-ble

# Start monitoring & protection
sudo python3 pixiebt.py -m 2

# Monitor without BLE
sudo python3 pixiebt.py -m 2 --no-ble

# With a custom config file
sudo python3 pixiebt.py -m 2 -c /etc/pixiebt/custom.conf
```
